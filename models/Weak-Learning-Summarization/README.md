# Summarization

This repository contains scripts for a weak learning summarization pipeline in Arabic and English. See Conda Environment Setup below.


Overview:
1. Generate stories (snorkel_compute_labels_languageagnostic.py)
2. Run snorkel pipeline to get labels (snorkel_compute_labels_languageagnostic.py). There is a hard-coded boolean (arabic=True) to switch between Arabic and English.
3. Train XLMRSum on training data (see BertSum-XLMRoberta/README.md for instructions)
4. Download Arabic data from https://sourceforge.net/projects/easc-corpus/ and unzip. Generate test stories (generate_stories_stanfordtokenizer.py) for Arabic data only, since CNNDM stories are available for download.
5. Test XLMRobertaSum on test data (see BertSum-XLMRoberta/README.md for instructions)
6. Assess output (test_bertsum_output.py)
7. Run weak learner assessment (test_summarizers.py)

## Code Set-Up

Prior to running code, copy BertSum-XLMRoberta/src/prepro/data_builder.py file to top level of repository. Copy BertSum-XLMRoberta/src/others/utils.py to top level of repository as bertsum_utils.py

The [text_summarizer](https://github.com/cordelia-io/centroid-summarizer/tree/d0b5bb150d3d94cde2086932787e44365e0b1e52/text_summarizer) package from the [centroid-summarizer](https://github.com/cordelia-io/centroid-summarizer/tree/d0b5bb150d3d94cde2086932787e44365e0b1e52) library is utilized in this code. Add in code from [centroid_bow.py](https://github.com/cordelia-io/centroid-summarizer/blob/d0b5bb150d3d94cde2086932787e44365e0b1e52/text_summarizer/centroid_bow.py) and [base.py]( https://github.com/cordelia-io/centroid-summarizer/blob/d0b5bb150d3d94cde2086932787e44365e0b1e52/text_summarizer/base.py) as described below. Code from external library centroid-summarizer distributed under the [GPL-v3 License](https://github.com/cordelia-io/centroid-summarizer/blob/d0b5bb150d3d94cde2086932787e44365e0b1e52/LICENSE).

Prior to running the code, make the following modifications in weak_summarizers.py. Modify weak_summarizers.py in 4 places:
1. line 41: copy in lines 17-21 from base.py
2. line 175: delete placeholder function definition
3. line 176:
	copy in lines 12, 18, 19 from centroid_bow.py
	
	copy in lines 21-23 from centroid_bow.py
	
	copy in lines 25 from centroid_bow.py; replace second argument with following two arguments: sentences, sentence_embeddings
	
	copy in line 36 from centroid_bow.py; replace name of variable to sum with sentence_embeddings
	
	copy in lines 37-40 from centroid_bow.py
	
	copy in lines 42-45 from centroid_bow.py; replace original name of embedding variable with sentence_embeddings; variable being indexed in second argument of final line should be sentences
	
	copy in line 47 from centroid_bow.py 
	
	copy in lines 49-66 from centroid_bow.py 
	
	copy in line 68 from centroid_bow.py; set the variable equal only to the list
	
4. line 178: copy in line 69 from centroid_bow.py; add ', summary_indices' to end of line

## Conda Environment Setup

1. conda env create -f environment.yml --name summarization
2. Alternative is to use requirements.txt
3. To install pyrouge on Linux, follow the 6-step instructions in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45894212/installing-pyrouge-gets-error-in-ubuntu (Note that you'll need to have the root right to execute Step 4)
