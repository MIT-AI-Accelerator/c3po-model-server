" There was a question about a PER1 who was code 4 (MTYP6, priority A, A4).  I have no problem with you putting a MC on there, i was trying to give you the option.  if you want an MC, i dont care.  Feel free to call US though, not ORG2.  ORG2 will only defer to us, who are again trying to give you the option.
