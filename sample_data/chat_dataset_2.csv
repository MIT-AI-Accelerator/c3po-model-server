good afternoon.
how are things at Davis?
Quiet.
Not that I'm complaining
lol
I hear you
do you need more time with the tracker?
I'm flexible
I've had no additions since I got here.  I'll just need 5 mins to get xfered over to the low side.
take your time.  I'm doing a few things at the same time here
good copy on the tracker
ditto on the take your time.  I'm here until 0230.  No rush.
lol
thank you
I'm still waiting on platform4 to come up.  has statement been sent for MYB1OF and 7Q6?
and my MTYP4 pages are down again.  this is going to be a bigger pain than it needs to be
According to our shift tracker they have. Still waiting a response for the PROG rsrc.

I can drop those two in the platform3 if it'll help.
platform4 is up now
how much of a pain is it to move ZWULDNZ?
it's this
I like pictures
easier than me trying to describe it that's for sure.
Will BB6SJYA fit on XLB4983CW183?
I'm thinking not
AEU looks like an easy answer
I'm hoping to put MYB1OF and TRA together.  see any issues with that other than one is at CFAB20 and the other is at CFAB10
what are your thoughts on PNK on LMZ9174CA041?
I'm thinking that won't fit
I don't beleive BB6SJYA will fit on BDTC3K3 as is.... But what if we did this.  Move F64I1AY TO  NFIW since its DL is the 281 day.  Then but BB6SJYA on  2FWGULWY since its DL is the 277 day?

debating taking the WV3s to CFAB10 then later mission take from CFAB10 to CFAB20
Those should be fairly easy to drive on and off.  But the xload might be the safer option.

PNK will take up most of the jet.  You'll only have the 4 pallet positions on the ramp left on the way down range.  As for the return leg...idk.  maybe they'll have some backlog or some other rsrc will pop up before the 279.

and I'm locked out of MTYP4 pages
I'd like to have more than 8 pallets
let me work the other ENUM's first.  I'm thinking for right now the CFAB18 is low priority with no rush for CLTP2.  I could schedule a MNUM with space available and it could be moved later if need be.  Or sit on it.  lets see how com treats me today.

Hey Reynolds.  I'm calling it quits for today there
VQ7V8LDS is a small WV2 trailer?
we'll have to build a MNUM for it
CFAB18 is not a rush.
CFAB15 we have time to build that one before CLTP2
I am again your planner for tomorrow
any questions or thoughts?
okie dokie.  Nah works for me as long as the CFAB15 stuff won't be hard deal with later.  It's their food/water.
