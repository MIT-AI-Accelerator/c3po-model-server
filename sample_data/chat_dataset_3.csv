Morning
 @Todd.Faith so...about that SYS8 reservation on the 15th...can you make those over the 15th AND 16th?  the per10 keeps asking for a quadruple shuttle with GRP7...which isnt going to happen so id rather just reserve the jets and crews now and coordinate with the powers that be before it becomes an issue
Ok
thank you sir

" yeah, we are tracking it down                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "
It's  UHX789 & KPORV6.  He was saying it's at the CFAB10
@Todd.Faith would you mind throwing 4 BT's for IAF0 MSTYP reservation?  Just in case someone calls MTYP2 desk?
I put in on SYS8 only
copy thanks!  i had the MSTYP planner put it in SYS1 so all should be g2g
can you please drop the current SYS8 file here (not the pdf)

" Take a look at the mission I highlighted in red 10LXVLO if you get a chance.   Why is this one going to CFAB09?  Since CFAB21 is a MTYP5 stop, and that is where the cargo is going.

Good afternoon.
Afternoon.
hi
Stepping out for a bit to get some air.
wait!
morning
and at earliest convenience can i get a new SYS8...Thanks!
EPN9933HR199: The CFAB09 MTYP5 stop has changed to CFAB21 at the request of the Mcilhinney.
how are things over there?
is the 3D5IMDGV CFAB09 to CFAB21 change done?
Done and yes.  Things are slow.  And do you do sir?
 3 ENUM's on tracker for me.  I'll address the CFAB15 first.  .
2 ENUMs left on tracker.
so id say wait until monday for that location2 one because generally that is when more requirements get put on the tracker
ok
so now I'm down to 8 pallets for CFAB18
yep
I'm thinking I'll build a MNUM for CFAB18 for the 8 pallets then it can be moved if more CFAB18 cargo pops up
actually
on the CFAB18 thought
" build MNUM or sit on it.  would be specific CLTP2, not much CLTP2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             "
id say  build it and see if we get another requirement that can fit on it
other option would be to split up NPLOX1TE
XCLG69VP could take some of it
that XIV7D cargo is pretty heavy without anything else being added
" you're right, I forgot about weight already                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "

Since OJO really only has a trailer I wonder if I can add it to FWT0191FQ253.  Will it fit on C12 if CLTP2 lets me add it??
It wont work unfortunately. We won't have the room on C12 to fit 05DR4OR with the already fragged cargo
